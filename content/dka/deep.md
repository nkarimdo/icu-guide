# Deep Guide: Comprehensive DKA Management

## 1. Pathophysiology
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and ketonuria. It occurs due to an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin combined with an increase in counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, growth hormone). 
* **Lipolysis:** Without insulin, the body breaks down fat into free fatty acids.
* **Ketogenesis:** The liver converts these fatty acids into ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), leading to metabolic acidosis.
* **Osmotic Diuresis:** Hyperglycemia causes severe fluid and electrolyte depletion through the urine.

## 2. Assessment and Severity
Classified usually by mental status and pH:
* **Mild:** pH 7.25 - 7.30, Alert
* **Moderate:** pH 7.00 - 7.24, Alert/Drowsy
* **Severe:** pH < 7.00, Stupor/Coma

### Initial Labs to Order:
* Point-of-care glucose
* Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) to calculate Anion Gap: `Na - (Cl + HCO3)`
* Serum ketones (specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate)
* Venous Blood Gas (VBG) or Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)
* CBC, Urinalysis, HbA1c, Phosphorus, Magnesium
* EKG (to check for signs of hyper/hypokalemia)

## 3. Step-by-Step Management

### A. Fluid Resuscitation
Patients are usually profoundly dehydrated (deficit of 6-9 Liters).
* **Hour 1:** 1.0 to 1.5 L of 0.9% NaCl.
* **Subsequent Hours:** Calculate corrected sodium: `Measured Na + 1.6 * ((Glucose - 100) / 100)`.
    * If corrected Na is high or normal: Change fluids to 0.45% NaCl at 250-500 mL/hr.
    * If corrected Na is low: Continue 0.9% NaCl at 250-500 mL/hr.
* **Dextrose Addition:** When blood glucose drops to 200 mg/dL, change fluids to D5-0.45% NaCl. *Why?* To allow continued insulin infusion to close the anion gap without causing hypoglycemia.

### B. Electrolyte Management
* **Potassium:** Insulin drives potassium *into* cells. Even if serum potassium looks normal initially, total body potassium is severely depleted. Do not start insulin if K+ is under 3.3 mEq/L.
* **Bicarbonate:** Use is highly controversial. Generally reserved ONLY for severe acidosis (pH < 6.9) to prevent fatal arrhythmias. Give 100 mmol sodium bicarbonate in 400 mL sterile water with 20 mEq KCl over 2 hours.
* **Phosphate:** Only replace if severe (< 1.0 mg/dL) or accompanied by cardiac dysfunction/respiratory depression.

### C. Insulin Therapy
* Insulin halts ketogenesis and corrects the acidosis. 
* Regular insulin is used intravenously. 
* If glucose falls below 200 mg/dL but the anion gap is still open (acidosis hasn't cleared), do not stop the insulin. Instead, decrease the rate and ensure Dextrose is running in the IV fluids.

## 4. Monitoring and Complications
* **Checks:** Blood glucose every 1 hr. BMP and VBG every 2-4 hrs until stable.
* **Cerebral Edema:** Rare but fatal, mostly seen in children/adolescents. Watch for sudden headache, lethargy, or bradycardia. Treatment is Mannitol or Hypertonic Saline.
* **Hypoglycemia / Hypokalemia:** The most common iatrogenic complications. Monitor diligently.

## 5. Transitioning to Subcutaneous Insulin
Never stop the IV insulin abruptly. 
1. Ensure the patient is able to eat.
2. Administer a dose of long-acting (basal) subcutaneous insulin.
3. Keep the IV insulin running for 1–2 hours post-injection to allow the SubQ insulin to absorb and begin working.
