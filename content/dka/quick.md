# Quick Guide: DKA Management Protocol

**Diagnostic Criteria**
* Blood Glucose (BG): > 250 mg/dL
* Arterial pH: < 7.30
* Bicarbonate: < 18 mEq/L
* Anion Gap: > 10
* Urine/Serum: Positive for ketones

### Step 1: IV Fluids (The First Step)
* **Initial:** 0.9% Normal Saline (NS) at 15–20 mL/kg/hr (roughly 1 to 1.5 L) during the first hour.
* **Maintenance:** Switch to 0.45% NaCl if corrected serum sodium is normal or high. Keep at 0.9% NaCl if corrected sodium is low. Rate: 250–500 mL/hr.
* **When BG reaches 200 mg/dL:** Add 5% Dextrose (D5W) to the IV fluids.

### Step 2: Potassium (K+)
* **Check before starting Insulin!**
* **If K+ is < 3.3 mEq/L:** HOLD insulin. Give 20-30 mEq K+/hr until K+ is > 3.3.
* **If K+ is 3.3 - 5.2 mEq/L:** Give 20-30 mEq K+ per liter of IV fluid to keep K+ between 4.0 and 5.0. Start insulin.
* **If K+ is > 5.2 mEq/L:** Do not give K+. Check serum K+ every 2 hours. Start insulin.

### Step 3: Insulin
* **Route:** Regular Insulin IV.
* **Dose:** 0.1 U/kg IV bolus, followed by 0.1 U/kg/hr continuous infusion. (Alternatively, skip the bolus and start at 0.14 U/kg/hr).
* **Goal:** Decrease BG by 50-75 mg/dL per hour.

### Step 4: Resolution & Transition
* **Resolution Criteria:** BG < 200 mg/dL AND two of the following: Bicarbonate >= 15 mEq/L, venous pH > 7.3, calculated anion gap <= 12.
* **Transition:** Start subcutaneous (SubQ) basal insulin. Continue the IV insulin drip for 1 to 2 hours *after* giving the SubQ injection to prevent rebound DKA.
