# ICU Quick Guide: Shock

## Definition & Initial Approach
Shock is a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, or inadequate oxygen utilization. 
* **Recognize early:** Hypotension (MAP < 65), tachycardia, altered mental status, oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/hr), mottled skin, elevated lactate.
* **The VIP Approach:** **V**entilate (oxygenation/airway), **I**nfuse (fluid resuscitation), **P**ump (vasoactive agents).

## Hemodynamic Profiles of Shock

| Shock Type | Cardiac Output (CO) | Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) | CVP / PCWP | Primary Issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypovolemic** | Decreased | Increased | Decreased | Loss of preload (hemorrhage, GI loss). |
| **Cardiogenic** | Decreased | Increased | Increased | Pump failure (MI, arrhythmia, valve failure). |
| **Distributive** | Increased / Normal | Decreased | Decreased / Normal | Vasodilation (Sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic). |
| **Obstructive** | Decreased | Increased | Increased | Extracardiac flow blockage (PE, tamponade, tension PTX). |

## 1st Line Vasopressors & Inotropes
* **Sepsis/Distributive:** Norepinephrine (0.01 - 3 mcg/kg/min). Add Vasopressin (0.03 units/min) if refractory.
* **Cardiogenic:** Norepinephrine (for MAP) + Dobutamine or Milrinone (for inotropy). Avoid pure vasoconstrictors if possible.
* **Anaphylactic:** Epinephrine (IM early, IV drip if refractory).
* **Neurogenic:** Norepinephrine or Phenylephrine (focus on restoring SVR).

## Initial Actions Check
* Obtain IV access (2 large bore peripheral or Central Line).
* Draw labs: VBG/ABG, Lactate, CMP, CBC, Coags, Blood Cultures x2.
* Perform RUSH Exam (POCUS) to determine shock etiology.
* Target MAP > 65 mmHg and trend lactate clearance.
