# ICU Deep Guide: Shock Pathophysiology & Advanced Management

## Pathophysiology of Cellular Hypoxia
Shock is not merely hypotension; it is a mismatch between oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2). When DO2 falls below a critical threshold, cells shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, producing lactate and eventually leading to cell death, endothelial dysfunction, and multiorgan failure syndrome (MODS).

## Advanced Diagnostics & Monitoring
* **POCUS (RUSH Exam):** Evaluates Pump (heart), Tank (IVC/pleura/peritoneum), and Pipes (aorta/DVT). Essential for undifferentiated shock.
* **Arterial Line:** Gold standard for continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent ABGs/lactate checks.
* **Central Venous Catheter (CVC):** Allows for central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) monitoring, secure vasopressor delivery, and CVP measurement (though static CVP is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness).
* **Dynamic Fluid Assessment:** Passive leg raise (PLR) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) on a mechanically ventilated patient are superior to static measures for determining fluid responsiveness.

## Pharmacological Receptor Targets

| Agent | Alpha-1 (Vessels) | Beta-1 (Heart) | Beta-2 (Lungs/Vessels) | Dopaminergic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Norepinephrine** | ++++ | ++ | 0 | 0 |
| **Epinephrine** | ++++ | ++++ | +++ | 0 |
| **Phenylephrine** | ++++ | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Dobutamine** | + | ++++ | ++ | 0 |
| **Dopamine (High Dose)**| +++ | ++ | 0 | ++++ |

## Detailed Management by Etiology

### Distributive Shock (Sepsis)
* **Pathology:** Endothelial injury, glycocalyx shedding, and severe vasoplegia driven by cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6).
* **Management:** 30 cc/kg crystalloid within 3 hours (assess tolerance). Early broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour. Norepinephrine is first line. Add Vasopressin at 0.03 U/min to spare catecholamines. Consider stress-dose hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) if poorly responsive to vasopressors.

### Cardiogenic Shock
* **Pathology:** Severe impairment of myocardial performance resulting in diminished CO, end-organ hypoperfusion, and tissue hypoxia.
* **Management:** Identify reversible causes (CATH lab for STEMI). Cautious fluid administration (often require diuresis instead). Norepinephrine for MAP support. Inotropes (Dobutamine/Milrinone) to increase CO, but watch for hypotension and arrhythmias. Consider mechanical circulatory support (IABP, Impella, VA-ECMO) early for refractory cases.

### Hypovolemic Shock
* **Pathology:** Absolute loss of intravascular volume decreasing venous return (preload) and stroke volume.
* **Management:** Identify source (hemorrhagic vs. non-hemorrhagic). For hemorrhage, activate massive transfusion protocol (MTP) aiming for 1:1:1 ratio of PRBCs, FFP, and Platelets. Permissive hypotension (MAP ~60) may be appropriate in trauma to prevent blowing clots until surgical control is achieved.

### Obstructive Shock
* **Pathology:** Physical obstruction to blood flow into or out of the heart.
* **Management:** Treat the underlying cause immediately. Tension pneumothorax requires needle decompression/chest tube. Cardiac tamponade requires pericardiocentesis. Massive PE requires systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, or surgical embolectomy.
