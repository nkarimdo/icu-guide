# Quick Guide: GI Bleed Management in the ICU

## 1. Initial Assessment & Resuscitation (ABCs)
* **Airway:** Intubate for airway protection if massive hematemesis, encephalopathy, or shock to prevent aspiration (especially prior to endoscopy).
* **Access:** Place 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (18G or larger) or a Cordis. A standard triple-lumen central line is insufficient for rapid volume resuscitation.
* **Fluids:** Initiate crystalloid resuscitation (Lactated Ringer's or Plasmalyte). 

## 2. Stat Labs
* Type & Crossmatch (at least 2-4 units PRBCs)
* CBC, CMP (check BUN/Cr ratio > 30 suggests UGIB)
* Coagulation panel (PT/INR, PTT)
* Lactate and VBG (tissue perfusion assessment)

## 3. Transfusion Thresholds
* **Target Hb:** > 7 g/dL for most patients.
* **Target Hb:** > 9 g/dL for patients with active acute coronary syndrome or massive, ongoing exsanguination.
* *Note:* Over-transfusing in portal hypertension can increase portal pressures and worsen variceal bleeding.

## 4. Empiric Pharmacotherapy
* **PPI:** Pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus, followed by 8 mg/hr continuous infusion (or 40 mg IV BID, which is showing non-inferiority, but drip remains common in ICU).
* **Suspected Variceal (Cirrhotics or stigmata of liver disease):**
    * **Octreotide:** 50 mcg IV bolus, followed by 50 mcg/hr continuous infusion (splanchic vasoconstriction).
    * **Antibiotics:** Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily (max 7 days) for SBP prophylaxis and mortality reduction.

## 5. Consults & Interventions
* **Gastroenterology:** Stat consult for urgent Endoscopy (EGD) within 12-24 hours (or sooner if unstable).
* **Prokinetics:** Erythromycin 250 mg IV 30-120 minutes prior to EGD to clear the stomach of clots.
* **Interventional Radiology (IR) / Surgery:** Consult early if endoscopy fails or if bleeding is massive and uncontrollable.
