# Deep Dive: Comprehensive ICU Management of Gastrointestinal Bleeding

## 1. Pathophysiology and Triage
Severe GI bleeding requires immediate differentiation between Upper (UGIB) and Lower (LGIB) sources, as well as Variceal vs. Non-Variceal etiologies.
* **Upper GIB:** Proximal to the ligament of Treitz. Presents with hematemesis or melena. Elevated BUN/Cr ratio (>30:1) is highly suggestive due to blood breakdown and absorption in the GI tract, plus pre-renal azotemia.
* **Lower GIB:** Distal to the ligament of Treitz. Presents with hematochezia. *Caveat:* Massive, rapid UGIB can also present with hematochezia due to rapid transit time.

### Risk Stratification Scores
* **Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS):** Calculated pre-endoscopy. Uses BUN, Hb, systolic BP, pulse, and clinical markers (melena, syncope, hepatic disease, heart failure). Score > 1 requires intervention/admission.
* **Rockall Score:** Identifies patients at risk of adverse outcomes post-endoscopy. 

## 2. Advanced Resuscitation & Coagulopathy Reversal
* **Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP):** Activate if the patient requires > 4 units of blood in 1 hour or > 10 units in 24 hours. Aim for a 1:1:1 ratio of PRBCs, FFP, and Platelets to prevent dilutional coagulopathy.
* **Calcium:** Monitor ionized calcium closely. Citrate in banked blood chelates calcium, leading to hypocalcemia which impairs clotting and cardiac contractility.
* **Anticoagulation Reversal:**
    * *Warfarin:* Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (4-factor PCC / Kcentra) + IV Vitamin K 10mg.
    * *Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (Dabigatran):* Idarucizumab (Praxbind).
    * *Factor Xa Inhibitors (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban):* Andexanet alfa, or 4-factor PCC if Andexanet is unavailable.

## 3. Targeted Medical Management

### Non-Variceal Upper GI Bleed (NVUGIB)
* *Etiologies:* Peptic ulcer disease (most common), Mallory-Weiss tears, esophagitis, Dieulafoy lesions.
* *Management:* High-dose IV PPI. The acidic environment of the stomach impairs platelet aggregation and clot stabilization. Maintaining gastric pH > 6.0 stabilizes the clot. 

### Variceal Upper GI Bleed
* *Etiologies:* Esophageal or gastric varices due to portal hypertension.
* *Management:* * **Vasoactive drugs:** Octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin. These reduce portal venous inflow by constricting splanchnic arterioles.
    * **Prophylactic Antibiotics:** Mandatory. Significantly reduces the risk of rebleeding and death in cirrhotics. Ceftriaxone is preferred.
    * **Rescue Therapy:** If endoscopic banding/sclerotherapy fails, consider balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore or Minnesota tube) as a bridge (max 24 hours due to necrosis risk) to Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS).

### Lower GI Bleed
* *Etiologies:* Diverticulosis (most common), angiodysplasia, ischemic colitis, post-polypectomy, hemorrhoids.
* *Management:* Hemodynamically stable patients usually undergo bowel prep for colonoscopy. If massively bleeding and unstable, a CT Angiography (CTA) is the preferred diagnostic modality (requires active bleeding rate of at least 0.3-0.5 mL/min), followed by targeted IR embolization. 

## 4. Endoscopy Timing & Considerations
* **Urgent EGD (< 12 hours):** Recommended for patients with suspected variceal bleeding or those with NVUGIB who are hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitation.
* **Early EGD (Within 24 hours):** Standard of care for most hospitalized UGIB patients.
* **Airway Protection:** Prophylactic endotracheal intubation should be strongly considered in patients with active hematemesis, encephalopathy, or severe agitation to prevent massive aspiration during the endoscopic procedure.
