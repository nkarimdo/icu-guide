## Clinical Guidelines and Foundational Trials
1.  **The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDSnet):**
    * *Ventilation with Lower Tidal Volumes as Compared with Traditional Tidal Volumes for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.* N Engl J Med 2000; 342:1301-1308. 
    * This is the foundational text for lung-protective ventilation and the 4-6 mL/kg IBW strategy.
2.  **Surviving Sepsis Campaign:**
    * International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock. Includes established recommendations on ventilation strategies for sepsis-induced ARDS.

## Textbooks & Manuals
3.  **The ICU Book by Paul L. Marino:**
    * A gold-standard reference. Provides excellent, easily digestible chapters on the physics of mechanical ventilation, ventilator modes, and weaning protocols.
4.  **Principles and Practice of Mechanical Ventilation by Martin J. Tobin:**
    * The definitive, comprehensive textbook on the subject. Ideal for deep dives into respiratory physiology and ventilator dyssynchrony.

## Digital & FOAMed Resources
5.  **Life in the Fast Lane (LITFL):**
    * Critical Care Compendium (CCC) - Section on Mechanical Ventilation. Excellent for quick bedside troubleshooting and mnemonic reviews (like DOPE).
6.  **Internet Book of Critical Care (IBCC):**
    * Created by Josh Farkas. Phenomenal online textbook offering pragmatic, modern approaches to airway management, ARDS, and ventilator liberation.
7.  **UpToDate:**
    * *Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit.*
    * *Modes of mechanical ventilation.*
