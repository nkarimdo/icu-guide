# ARDS Deep Guide

## 1. Pathophysiology
ARDS is an acute inflammatory lung injury characterized by increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue. 
* **Exudative Phase (Days 1-7):** Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), capillary leak, protein-rich edema, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation.
* **Proliferative Phase (Days 7-21):** Repair process begins. Type II pneumocytes proliferate to replace damaged Type I cells. Fibroblast proliferation starts.
* **Fibrotic Phase (Weeks to Months):** Occurs in a subset of patients. Widespread fibrosis, bullae formation, and severe disruption of architecture leading to chronic mechanical ventilation dependence or death.

## 2. Advanced Ventilator Management
The primary goal in ARDS ventilation is preventing Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI), specifically volutrauma (too much volume), barotrauma (too much pressure), and atelectrauma (repeated opening and closing of alveoli).

* **Predicted Body Weight (PBW) Calculation:**
    * Male: 50 + 2.3 [height (inches) - 60]
    * Female: 45.5 + 2.3 [height (inches) - 60]
* **Driving Pressure ($\Delta$P):** Calculated as Plateau Pressure - PEEP. Aim for $\Delta$P < 15 cmH2O. This is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in ARDS.
* **Permissive Hypercapnia:** Allowing PaCO2 to rise is acceptable (and often necessary) to maintain low tidal volumes, provided the arterial pH remains $\ge$ 7.20. (Contraindicated in elevated ICP or severe right heart failure).

## 3. Evidence-Based Interventions & Trials
* **Low Tidal Volume Ventilation (ARDSNet 2000):** Established 6 mL/kg PBW as the standard of care, showing a 9% absolute mortality reduction compared to 12 mL/kg.
* **Conservative Fluid Management (FACTT 2006):** Demonstrated that a conservative fluid strategy (diuresis or fluid restriction once shock resolves) increases ventilator-free days without worsening renal function.
* **Prone Positioning (PROSEVA 2013):** Found a significant mortality benefit (16% vs 32.8%) when patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F < 150) were proned for $\ge$ 16 hours a day.
* **Neuromuscular Blockade (ACURASYS 2010 vs. ROSE 2019):** ACURASYS initially showed a mortality benefit for 48 hours of cisatracurium in early, severe ARDS. The later ROSE trial showed no mortality benefit over a light sedation strategy. NMBAs are now primarily reserved for severe ventilator dyssynchrony.

## 4. Complications and Long-Term Outcomes
* **ICU-Acquired Weakness:** High risk due to prolonged immobilization, steroids, and paralytics.
* **Cognitive Impairment:** Significant rates of long-term cognitive decline and PTSD following ARDS survival.
* **Pulmonary Function:** Most survivors regain near-normal lung function within 6-12 months, but exercise limitation and reduced diffusion capacity (DLCO) can persist.
