# Hyponatremia: Comprehensive Clinical Guide

## Pathophysiology & SIADH Criteria
Hyponatremia is primarily a water problem, not a sodium problem. It reflects an excess of total body water relative to total body sodium. 

**Essential Criteria for SIADH Diagnosis:**
1.  True hypotonic hyponatremia (Serum Osm < 275).
2.  Inappropriate urinary concentration (Urine Osm > 100) at some level of hypoosmolality.
3.  Clinical euvolemia.
4.  Elevated urinary sodium excretion (Urine Na > 20-40 mEq/L) on normal dietary salt intake.
5.  Absence of thyroid, adrenal, or renal dysfunction.
6.  No recent use of diuretic agents.

## Correcting the Sodium
When deciding on fluids, you must calculate how a specific infusate will affect the patient's serum sodium. 

**Adrogué-Madias Formula**
Use this to estimate the effect of 1 liter of infusate on serum sodium:
$$\Delta[\text{Na}^+] = \frac{[\text{Na}^+]_{\text{inf}} - [\text{Na}^+]_{\text{s}}}{\text{TBW} + 1}$$

*Where:*
* $[\text{Na}^+]_{\text{inf}}$ = Sodium concentration of infusate (e.g., Normal Saline = 154, 3% Saline = 513).
* $[\text{Na}^+]_{\text{s}}$ = Current serum sodium.
* $\text{TBW}$ (Total Body Water) = $\text{Weight (kg)} \times \text{Factor}$ (0.6 for men, 0.5 for women/elderly men, 0.45 for elderly women).

*Clinical Pearl:* The Adrogué-Madias formula is an *estimate* and assumes a closed system. It does not account for ongoing urinary losses. Frequent serum sodium checks (q2-4 hours) are mandatory during active correction.

## Managing the Risk of Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS)
Overly rapid correction shrinks brain cells, leading to demyelination, most classically in the pons (Central Pontine Myelinolysis). Symptoms (dysarthria, dysphagia, quadriparesis, "locked-in" syndrome) typically lag 2-6 days behind the rapid correction.

**The DDAVP Clamp Strategy**
For patients with profound hyponatremia (Na < 120) and a high risk of auto-correcting rapidly (e.g., a hypovolemic patient being resuscitated, stopping a thiazide diuretic, or a beer potomania patient who starts eating):
* Administer Desmopressin (DDAVP) 1-2 mcg IV q8h to "clamp" the kidneys and prevent free water diuresis.
* Simultaneously administer 3% hypertonic saline to drive the sodium up at a strictly controlled rate.
* This removes the unpredictability of the patient's intrinsic ADH shutting off.

**Overcorrection Rescue**
If the sodium rises too fast (e.g., > 8 mEq/L in 24 hours):
1. Stop any sodium-containing fluids immediately.
2. Infuse D5W (free water) at 3-6 mL/kg/hr.
3. Administer DDAVP 2 mcg IV to stop further water loss.
