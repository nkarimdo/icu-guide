# Key Sepsis Guidelines and Literature

1.  **Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021:** * Evans L, Rhodes A, Alhazzani W, et al. [*Surviving sepsis campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021.*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06506-y) Intensive Care Med. 2021;47(11):1181-1247. 
    * *Significance:* The current definitive guidelines for the hour-1 bundle, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor strategies.

2.  **Sepsis-3 Definitions:**
    * Singer M, Deutschman CS, Seymour CW, et al. [*The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).*](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2016.0287) JAMA. 2016;315(8):801–810.
    * *Significance:* Shifted definition from SIRS criteria to SOFA score and defined septic shock by lactate and vasopressor requirements.

3.  **ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Trial:**
    * Hernández G, Ospina-Tascón GA, Damiani LP, et al. [*Effect of a Resuscitation Strategy Targeting Peripheral Perfusion Status vs Serum Lactate Levels on 28-Day Mortality Among Patients With Septic Shock: The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Randomized Clinical Trial.*](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.0071) JAMA. 2019;321(7):654–664.
    * *Significance:* Demonstrated that capillary refill time is at least as effective as, and potentially superior to, lactate clearance for guiding early shock resuscitation.

4.  **SMART Trial:**
    * Semler MW, Self WH, Wanderer JP, et al. [*Balanced Crystalloids versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults.*](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1711584) N Engl J Med. 2018;378(9):829-839.
    * *Significance:* Supports the use of balanced crystalloids (like Lactated Ringer's) over normal saline to reduce Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days (MAKE30).

5.  **NICE-SUGAR Trial:**
    * The NICE-SUGAR Study Investigators. [*Intensive versus Conventional Glucose Control in Critically Ill Patients.*](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625) N Engl J Med. 2009;360:1283-1297.
    * *Significance:* Established the current standard of avoiding tight glycemic control due to increased mortality from severe hypoglycemia.
