# SEPSIS — QUICK CLINICAL GUIDE

## Definition
Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

Operational criteria:
- Suspected infection **PLUS**
- ≥2 point increase in SOFA score

---

## Identify Early (Screening)

### SIRS (Sensitive)
- Temp >38 or <36
- HR >90
- RR >20 or PaCO₂ <32
- WBC >12k, <4k, or >10% bands

### qSOFA (Specific — bedside)
Score ≥2 → high risk:
- RR ≥22
- SBP ≤100
- Altered mentation

---

## Septic Shock
Sepsis with:
- Persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors **AND**
- Lactate ≥2 mmol/L despite fluids

---

## 1-HOUR BUNDLE (CRITICAL)

### Immediately:
1. Measure lactate
2. Obtain blood cultures
3. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics
4. Give 30 mL/kg IV crystalloid
5. Start vasopressors if MAP <65

---

## Initial Resuscitation

### Fluids
Preferred:
- Balanced crystalloids (LR/Plasma-Lyte)

Goal:
- MAP ≥65
- Lactate clearance
- UOP ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr

---

## Vasopressors

First-line:
- **Norepinephrine**

Second-line:
- Vasopressin (add-on)
- Epinephrine

Refractory:
- Consider hydrocortisone

---

## Source Control
Must occur ASAP:
- Drain abscess
- Remove infected lines
- Surgical intervention

---

## Antibiotics
Start within 1 hour.

Empiric coverage depends on:
- Source
- Healthcare exposure
- MDR risk

Common initial regimens:
- Vancomycin + Piperacillin-tazobactam
- Vancomycin + Cefepime

---

## Monitoring Targets

| Parameter | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| MAP | ≥65 |
| Lactate | Downtrending |
| UOP | ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr |
| Mental status | Improving |

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Delayed antibiotics
- Under-resuscitation
- Missing source control
- Over-reliance on SIRS alone

---

## Mortality Risk Indicators
- Elevated lactate >4
- Hypotension
- AKI
- Mechanical ventilation need
