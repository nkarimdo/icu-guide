# Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - Deep Dive & Diagnostics

## 1. Diagnostic Workup
When a patient bumps their Cr, work through this systematic approach:
* **Vitals & Exam:** Orthostatics, JVP, edema, skin rash (AIN, atheroemboli), signs of infection.
* **Chart Biopsy:** Review recent meds (antibiotics, PPIs, NSAIDs), IV contrast exposure, recent surgeries, or hypotensive episodes.
* **Labs:** BMP, Phosphorous, Uric Acid, CK (if concern for rhabdo), CBC (schistocytes for TMA).
* **Urine Studies:**
    * Urinalysis (UA) with microscopy (the "liquid kidney biopsy").
    * Urine electrolytes (Na, Cr, Urea).
* **Imaging:** Renal Ultrasound (RUS) to rule out hydronephrosis/post-renal obstruction.

## 2. Urine Indices & Calculations

### Fractional Excretion of Sodium ($FE_{Na}$)
Useful for oliguric patients to differentiate pre-renal etiology from ATN. It is inaccurate if the patient has received recent loop diuretics.
$$FE_{Na} = \left( \frac{U_{Na} \times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \times U_{Cr}} \right) \times 100$$
* **< 1%:** Pre-renal (Kidneys are actively holding onto sodium to restore volume).
* **> 2%:** ATN (Tubular damage prevents sodium reabsorption).

### Fractional Excretion of Urea ($FE_{Urea}$)
Use this if the patient is on diuretics, as urea reabsorption is primarily proximal and less affected by loop or thiazide diuretics.
$$FE_{Urea} = \left( \frac{U_{Urea} \times P_{Cr}}{P_{BUN} \times U_{Cr}} \right) \times 100$$
* **< 35%:** Pre-renal.
* **> 50%:** ATN.

## 3. Urine Microscopy Pearls
* **Muddy brown granular casts:** Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN).
* **White blood cell (WBC) casts:** Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN), pyelonephritis.
* **Red blood cell (RBC) casts / Dysmorphic RBCs:** Glomerulonephritis (GN).
* **Hyaline casts:** Non-specific, but often seen in concentrated urine (pre-renal states).

## 4. Nuanced Management Strategies
* **Fluid Challenge vs. Diuresis:** Assessing volume status is notoriously difficult. Consider a POCUS assessment of the IVC, a VExUS score, or a cautious fluid challenge (e.g., 250-500 cc LR) if the patient appears pre-renal without obvious overload. Conversely, if dealing with cardiorenal syndrome, aggressive diuresis is often the cure for the AKI, despite the initial Cr bump.
* **"Renal Dose" Adjustments:** Proactively adjust renally cleared medications (e.g., gabapentin, DOACs, beta-lactams) based on a dynamically changing Cr, not just the admission baseline.
* **Contrast-Associated AKI:** Often overdiagnosed. True risk is highest in patients with pre-existing CKD (eGFR < 30) or hemodynamic instability. Volume expansion with IV isotonic crystalloids is the best preventative measure.
